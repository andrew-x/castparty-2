- User asked Claude to check Claude Code docs on how rules scoping works, noting database rules should be scoped to TS files only.
- Claude searched for Claude Code rules scoping documentation and found examples of YAML frontmatter path-specific rules.
- Claude read the database.md rule file and identified it was missing path scoping.
- Claude added YAML frontmatter with `paths: ["src/**/*.ts"]` to scope the database rules only to TypeScript files in src/.
- Claude staged and committed the change with message "Scope database rules to TS files via paths frontmatter".
- User's stop hook reported uncommitted memory changes in `.memsearch/memory/2026-03-01.md` requiring staging and commit.
