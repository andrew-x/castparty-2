- User asked Claude to check Claude Code docs on how rules scoping works, noting database rules should be scoped to TS files only.
- Claude searched for Claude Code rules scoping documentation and found examples of YAML frontmatter path-specific rules.
- Claude read the database.md rule file and identified it was missing path scoping.
- Claude added YAML frontmatter with `paths: ["src/**/*.ts"]` to scope the database rules only to TypeScript files in src/.
- Claude staged and committed the change with message "Scope database rules to TS files via paths frontmatter".
- User's stop hook reported uncommitted memory changes in `.memsearch/memory/2026-03-01.md` requiring staging and commit.

- User asked Claude to help resolve merge errors from a rebase.
- Claude checked git status and found a rebase in progress with three conflicting files: `.memsearch/memory/2026-03-01.md`, `src/lib/db/drizzle/meta/0001_snapshot.json`, and `src/lib/db/schema.ts`.
- Claude resolved conflicts: kept `// --- DATA RELATIONS ---` comment in schema.ts, standardized JSON array formatting in 0001_snapshot.json, and kept HEAD's fuller session history in 2026-03-01.md.
- Claude staged all three resolved files and verified no remaining conflict markers remained using git diff --check.

- User reported additional merge errors during ongoing rebase.
- Claude checked git status and identified one unmerged file: `.memsearch/memory/2026-03-01.md` with merge conflict markers.
- Claude read the file, found HEAD/incoming branch conflict in session history, resolved by keeping HEAD's fuller session record, and staged the resolved file.
- Claude verified no remaining conflict markers with `git diff --check`.
- Rebase is now ready to continue (no commands remaining in queue).
