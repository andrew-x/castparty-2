# Coding Standards

## Developer Ergonomics First

Optimize for the developer reading the code, not just the machine executing it.
Maintainable, readable, and easy-to-work-with code is the default goal.
When brevity conflicts with clarity, choose clarity.

## Self-Documenting Code

Let naming, structure, and types communicate intent. Add comments only for:

- **Non-obvious logic** — e.g., a workaround for a library or browser quirk
- **Non-conventional patterns** — intentional deviation from the norm (explain why)
- **Especially complex algorithms or state machines**

Don't comment what the code clearly does. Comment *why* it does it.
